# Simple Player Controller with Cloning Ability

Welcome to the Simple Player Controller with Cloning Ability Unity project! This project features a flexible player controller with different movement behaviors and the ability to create clones of the player character. Below, you'll find an overview of the project's structure and functionality.

## Overview

This project utilizes Unity for game development and includes various scripts that handle player movement, cloning mechanics, and visual effects.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Explore the scripts and assets to understand the project structure.
4. Play around with the scenes to experience the gameplay.

## Features

### Player Movement

The player movement is implemented using different scripts:

- **PlatformerPlayerController**: Provides movement for a platformer-style character with the ability to jump and dash.
- **UfoMover**: Controls movement for a UFO-like character, allowing smooth directional movement and rotation.

### Cloning Mechanism

The project includes a cloning mechanic implemented with the following scripts:

- **CloneObject**: Represents a cloned object in the game world. It handles behaviors such as shrinking, fading, and applying visual effects.
- **CloneController**: Manages the spawning and behavior of clones. It allows for the creation of multiple clones with adjustable parameters.

### Visual Feel

- **SquishAndStretch**: Adds squash and stretch effect to the player character based on its velocity, enhancing visual feedback during movement.

## Usage

To integrate player movement or cloning mechanics into your own Unity project, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary scripts into your project.
2. Attach the scripts to relevant game objects in your scene.
3. Customize the parameters in the Inspector to suit your game's requirements.
4. Test and iterate on your implementation to achieve the desired gameplay experience.
