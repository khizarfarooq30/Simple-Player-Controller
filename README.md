# Simple Player Controller with Cloning Ability

Welcome to the Simple Player Controller with Cloning Ability Unity project! This project consists of scripts and assets for creating engaging gameplay experiences. Below, you'll find an overview of the project's structure and functionality.

## Overview

This project is developed using Unity, a powerful game development platform. It contains various scripts and components that handle player movement, cloning mechanics, and more. The project is organized into different script files, each serving a specific purpose.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Explore the scripts and assets to understand the project structure.
4. Play around with the scenes to experience the gameplay.

## Features

### Player Movement

This project implements player movement using two different scripts:

- **PlatformerPlayerController**: Handles movement for a platformer-style character.
- **UfoMover**: Controls movement for a UFO-like character.

Both scripts provide smooth movement mechanics and allow for customization of speed and rotation.

### Cloning Mechanism

The project includes a cloning mechanic implemented with the following scripts:

- **CloneObject**: Represents a cloned object in the game world. It handles behaviors such as shrinking and fading.
- **CloneController**: Manages the spawning and behavior of clones. It allows for the creation of multiple clones with adjustable parameters.

## Usage

To integrate player movement or cloning mechanics into your own Unity project, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary scripts into your project.
2. Attach the scripts to relevant game objects in your scene.
3. Customize the parameters in the Inspector to suit your game's requirements.
4. Test and iterate on your implementation to achieve the desired gameplay experience.
